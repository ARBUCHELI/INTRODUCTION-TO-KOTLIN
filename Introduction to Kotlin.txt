Welcome to the world of coding with Kotlin!

Kotlin is a programming language that, after its release in 2016 by JetBrains, quickly gained popularity amongst developers due to its concise syntax, additional safety features, and 
compatibility with the Java programming language.

Being a general-purpose programming language, Kotlin can be used for Android development, web development, data science, and more. In 2019, Google announced Kotlin as their preferred 
language for Android development.

The following applications use Kotlin in their tech stack:
